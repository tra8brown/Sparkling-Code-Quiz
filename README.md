# Sparkling-Code-Quiz
## A Code Quiz created by Tracee Brown to make a quiz out of JavaScript and learn a few things from the questions and answers to go with it and a timer that starts at the push of the start button and deducts time when select the wrong  answer. This was one of the more difficult challenges to make and i ran out of time, but i hope with more experience i can come back to this and finish it.
